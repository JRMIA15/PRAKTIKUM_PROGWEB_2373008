            it's hard to tell what goes through a baby elephant's mind when its
            mom is trying to put it to sleep. Do you think baby elephant wake up
            in the middle of the night and cry? Do their moms and dads take
            turns getting up with them to rock them back to sleep? How do you
            rock an elephant, anyway?

              A baby elephant hang out with it's mom, aunts and great aunts, and
              maybe even it's grandmother

          <p id="text3">
            And what about gorrilas? Today in the paper there's a story about a
            new gorrila that was just born in Franklin Park. Its mom is holding
            on to it just like any proud human mom. And I have to wonder if they
            go through as musch trauma as that human mom when it comes to sleep,
            and food, and diapers, and running into the street.

          <p id="text4">
            Why is it so easy for them? Are they better parents? Do they just
            not worry about every little detail? I've never known a gorrila to
            read and study carefully seventeen books on bringing up baby
            gorrilas. And they seem to know just what to do. They never worry
            about spoiling their little gorilla babies. They never worry about
            non having enough time with them. Now, dont get me wrong, I'd rather
            be human than a gorilla any day. Just imagine having to sit in a
            zoo. Forget discrete nursing... (Did you figure out yet that while
            gorillas were on my mind, I could only find a picture of the
            elephant?)
